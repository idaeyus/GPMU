# The Graphics Processing [Meta] Unit

## What is GPMU?

AI development is extremely popular. There are hundreds of developers building AI models but cannot train their models due to the high costs of GPUs.  
GPMUs solve this problem by using AI to simulate AI. We use META's LLAMA 90B (vision) model (via Groq API) to simulate the model made by users.

## How to use a GPMU?

1. Visit [The GPMU website](https://idaeyus.github.io/GPMU/)
2. Input your Groq API key, your model's code, your dataset, and other essential details that are requested.
3. Input your prompt and click on "Simulate Model."
4. Receive your simulated model's response with other important metrics like accuracy, along with an analysis of why your model would respond in that way.

## Important Information

1. Please input the dataset even if it is in the code.
2. Every time you simulate the model, a new simulation is created, which means that your model's previous simulation response will not affect your new simulation.
3. Chat history has been removed to prevent it from interfering with the AI's [90B] simulation response.
4. Make sure you simulate the model at least **TWICE** to ensure that the AI [90B] is simulating your model properly.
